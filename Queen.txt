Is this the real build?
Is this just fantasy.py?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from legacy
Open your IDE,
Look up to the docs and see,
I’m just a junior dev, I need no sympathy,
Because I’m quick to ship, quick to break,
Little merge, little rollback,
Any way the bugs flow doesn’t really matter to
Me, to me

Paaaaa,
Just killed a prod,
Pushed a fix straight to main, didn’t test at all,
Now it’s dead
Mama, sprint had just begun,
But now I’ve gone and nuked it all away
Papa, oooh,
Didn’t mean to make you cry,
If I’m not online again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on,
As if nothing really deploys

Too late, the pager’s come,
Sends exceptions down my spine, server aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I’ve got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the logs
Mama, oooh,
I don’t want to die,
I sometimes wish I’d never typed rm -rf /

I see a little silhouetto of a bug,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the refactor?

Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening CI
GitHub Actions, GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions — magnificoooo

I’m just a poor dev nobody loves me
He’s just a poor dev from a poor repo tree
Spare him his job from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me push?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you push
(Let him push!) Bismillah! We will not let you push
(Let him push!) Bismillah! We will not let you push
(Let me push) Will not let you push
(Let me push) (Never) never let you push
(Let me push) (Never) let you push (Let me push) Ah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh merge request, merge request, merge request, let me close
Beelzebub has a code review put aside for me, for me,
For meeeee

So you think you can block me and fail my CI
So you think you can comment “LGTM” then lie
Oh baby, can’t do this to me, baby,
Just gotta hotfix, just gotta hotfix outta here

Nothing really matters, anyone can code,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the stack trace blows… 🌬️💥
